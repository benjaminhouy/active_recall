Okubo
=====

Okubo is a simple spaced-repetition system which you can associate with Active Record models to be learned
(words in a foreign language, capital cities of the world etc.) and users in your system, Users study these 
words, and as they mark these attempts "right" or "wrong", Okubo will determine when they should be reviewed
next.

Okubo schedules items into boxes and uses this to determine the next study time for an item, based on the [Leitner System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system).
In the future it may support other popular algorithms, such as the Supermemo 2 algorithm (SM2).
